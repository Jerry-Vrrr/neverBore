      <p>
        In conventional usage, boredom is an emotional and occasionally
        psychological state experienced when an individual is left without
        anything in particular to do, is not interested in their surroundings,
        or feels that a day or period is dull or tedious. It is also understood
        by scholars as a modern phenomenon which has a cultural dimension.
