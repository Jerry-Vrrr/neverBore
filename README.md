# [neverBore]()

A reactive App made for loners to get un-bored and to unclog the creativity and productivity pipes of the gunk and goo that keep us from gettin' at it erryday!. And better yet, all activities are single person activities, so you will never need to put up annoying chatter from an activity buddy. 

The goal of this project was to create an app for a niche audience on a tight deadline of about 5 days from concept and design to execution and deployment. 

## Usage
A User lands on the main page of the app and can swipe through the carousel and the 4 categories of activities (Educational, Volunteer, Relaxation and Productivity).

When a user is ready to accept a bordom fighting activity, they can click `Save Activity` and view the currently saved activities by clicking `See Your Saved Activities`.

If a user wants to find out more information about a certain activity, they can click `Expand`. A modal will appear with a link to some tutorials on the activity.

Route to our About page to learn more about boredom and learn some (not boring) facts about boredom. Did you know that the German word for Boredom is "Hasselhoff"?

**Please note: Both Heroku and the site this api are hosted on can take time to ‘wake up’ when they haven’t been accessed recently. Please be patient with the initial load.


## Technologies Used
1. React
2. React Router
3. Cypress
4. SCSS


## Future Iterations
- The App could use some general "tightening" and I had wanted to implement a Tinder like swipe function where users can save or dismiss activities. That said, I will likely leave the App as is as a marker in space and time to look back at what I was able to accomplish in a few days in Mod 3 of The Turing School of Software Development.
